# MyVote Web Application

## How to Interact in its Current State (Stage 2)
My web application utilizes an external csv file representing the data that will be used to display analytics. Although not implemented at this time, new entries should be added to the csv file every time the user submits a new form. For now, the user should enter a polling location name already present in the csv file and should submit the form to see analytical information about that polling location (eg. "Central Senior Center", "Frank Fire Department", etc). Casing is ignored. Enter a new location name and submit the form again to see new analytical data.

## Libraries Used
