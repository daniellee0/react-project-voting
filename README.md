## About
Our web application has two main components, both designed to indulge voters on politics.

The first main feature allows users to provide voter feeback and obtain analytical data about voter turnout in Washington state. To use, simply fill out 
the county form and the feedback form. After submitting, users can see data on their specified county and voter feedback data from all users that responded
to the same form. The second feature allows users to analyze justice ideology. To use, select the justice and see how they compare against others. 

This app was bootstrapped with Create React App.
