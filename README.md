# react-project-starter

## *One* of you (chosen as you see fit) shall do the following:

1. Add your partner as a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/). This will allow you both to be able to push to the repository and collaborate on the code.

2. Using the terminal, create the scaffolding for a new React application with the [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) generator. You **must** make your app in the *root folder* of the assignment repo (**not** inside an additional "app" folder):

  ```bash 
  # create a react app in _this_ repo
  create-react-app .  # note the period!
  ```
  
3. I recommend you then "clean up" the src/ repository, removing the App.css and logo.svg files and all the content of App.js. You can then begin implementing your project fresh with a new <App> component.

4. Update the README file to explain what the project is about. You will also track how you both contributed to this stage here.

5. Create a `stage-2-yourname` folder in the assignment repo, and copy in your code so you can have that code for reference!

6. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

7. Send the information for this Git Repo to your partner (e.g. the Git clone link)

## Your partner shall now do the following: 

8. Your partner should then clone the repository so they have a copy on their own machine.

9. Your partner should similar create a folder *in the repo* called `stage-2-theirname` that contains their stage-2 code, again to be used as reference.

10. Your partner should push this code back to GitHub, which you should pull down. 

## Now you are both ready to go!
